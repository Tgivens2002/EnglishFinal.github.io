        that are capable of being manipulated to mirror their surrounding environments. Racism present within the United
        States’ high school educational system has had a cascading effect on the growth and development of our nation's
        youth. This systematic cultural oppression inevitably leads to harmful behaviors and beliefs surrounding racism and
        how it affects people. It is essential that we create and instill an inclusive education system that promotes
        positivity and equality.

      <p>Aaliyah El-Amin remembers the afternoon she was tutoring a fourth-grade student on math
        problems. The student stopped, touched her arm, and asked if she ever wished she wasn’t black. The question
        was
        a painful one, which El-Amin recognized as the young girl trying to reconcile negative messages she heard
        about
        her race in our society.</p><br><br><br><br><br>

        being exposed to harmful language in a class-assigned novel. This brings up the question of whether a student is
        being allowed to prioritize their own safety or should they still be exposed to racism because it is part of the

    <p style="font-size: 1.3em;">Research findings from Lakeview High School indicate that most white teachers operated from an impaired consciousness about racism; that a majority "blamed the victim," assigning causality for racism to Blacks. Findings further indicate that of those who witnessed racist behavior by their white colleagues, the majority remained silent and did not challenge such behavior.

The issues caused by segregation have  trickled down to modern society, and until we learn from our history, we are bound to repeat it. Instead of leading students to higher chances of stereotyping and racist beliefs through a biased curriculum and oblivious educators, The United States needs to re-evaluate how and what its students are taught regarding racial tolerance. Students of color must be given the same opportunities as their white peers and as equality prevails our society as a whole will become one of inclusion.
